<- [x] Verify th# 🍁 MapleStory Progress Tracker - Copilot Instructions

## 📋 Project Overview
Angular-based MapleStory progress tracking tool with real-time character data integration via Nexon API.

## ✅ Completed Features
- [x] **Project Setup**: Angular 20+ with standalone components and signals-based reactive state
- [x] **Character Management**: CRUD operations with local storage persistence
- [x] **Nexon API Integration**: Real character images and data from official MapleStory rankings
- [x] **CORS Solution**: Comprehensive proxy server setup with request queuing
- [x] **UI/UX Design**: MapleStory-themed responsive interface with grid layouts
- [x] **Build System**: Production-ready builds with proper CSS budgets

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Core Services
- **`CharacterStorageService`**: Manages character data, local storage, and mock data generation
- **`NexonApiService`**: Handles official MapleStory API calls with CORS proxy support
- **`RequestQueueService`**: Prevents API rate limiting with sequential request processing

### Key Components
- **`HomeComponent`**: Primary character management interface with modal-based creation
- **Character Grid**: Responsive layout supporting real character images and loading states
- **Modal System**: Clean UX for character creation with error handling

### Data Flow
1. Character creation triggers async API lookup
2. Real Nexon data fetched via CORS proxy (corsproxy.io)
3. Character images and levels updated from official rankings
4. Graceful fallback to mock data if API unavailable

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Build & Deploy
```bash
ng build --configuration production --base-href='/Project-maple/'
npm run deploy  # GitHub Pages deployment
```

### CORS Development
```bash
node cors-proxy-server.js  # Local CORS proxy
ng serve --ssl              # HTTPS development server
```

### API Testing
- Use real MapleStory character names for testing
- Check browser console for API call debugging
- Monitor request queue performance

## 🔍 Key Learnings & Solutions

### CORS Resolution
- **Problem**: Browser security blocks direct Nexon API calls
- **Solution**: Express.js proxy server with proper CORS headers
- **Production**: Requires backend service or serverless functions

### CSS Bundle Management
- **Issue**: Large component stylesheets exceeded Angular budgets
- **Fix**: Increased budget limits from 4kB/8kB to 20kB/30kB in angular.json
- **Optimization**: Consider CSS purging for production

### TypeScript Error Resolution
- **Template/Component Mismatch**: Ensure async method signatures match template expectations
- **Cached Build Issues**: Use `ng cache clean` for stubborn compilation errors
- **Interface Updates**: Keep MapleCharacter interface in sync with template usage

### API Integration Patterns
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement request queues for external API calls
- **Error Handling**: Always provide fallback data for better UX
- **Loading States**: Use signals for reactive UI updates during async operations

## 🎯 Development Guidelines

### When Working with Character Data
- Always update both interface definitions and mock data generators
- Test with both real MapleStory names and fictional characters
- Ensure loading states are properly managed

### When Modifying API Services
- Maintain request queue for all external calls
- Log API responses for debugging
- Implement proper error boundaries

### Before Committing
1. Run `ng build` to verify compilation
2. Test character creation flow
3. Verify CORS proxy functionality if modified
4. Update this copilot-instructions.md with new learnings

## 🚀 Current Status
✅ **Fully Functional**: Character management with real Nexon API integration
✅ **Production Ready**: Builds successfully for GitHub Pages deployment
✅ **Developer Friendly**: Comprehensive error handling and debugging tools

## 📝 Next Development Areas
- Enhanced character statistics tracking
- Boss tracking and progress monitoring
- Equipment and progression systems
- Guild and ranking features
